## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- MongoDB
- DaisyUI
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

This was my first CRUD app that I completed on my own with my own idea. I knew I wanted to use Nextjs because of how easy it is to hook it to MongoDB and have access to a database. I learned a lot about Nextjs with this project and a lot about using NextAuth for authentication and connecting it to google provider.

I also used DaisyUI for the first time to which made the design portion much faster and seamless.

This project gave me lots of practice with routing as well as using GET and PATCH requests.



### Continued development

I plan to continue to expand my knowledge on Nextjs and incorporate server actions into my next project as well as start using TypeScript.
